# Weekly review

## Duration

01-05-25, 01-12-25

### Algorithm

Covered Red-Black Tree. a 2-3 tree, which 3-node is composed by 2 2-node, guarantee ops of $\theta(log n)$ time complexity.

**Why set color policies like root be black, no two consecutive red node? Worth to consider**

### Database

Memory management policy.

Mainly intro policy about LRU, LRU-K and cyclelike policy.

Started project 0 of Andy's Database course [project0](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2024/project0/).
The hyperloglog algo is based on statistic of independent experiment that every digits have even probability be 0 or 1 and every elements correspond value is independent, so count the longest 0 to detemine how many unique elements( flips ) the dataset containe . **Flip coin of bit!**

### Books

No longer upload progress of reading and book review.

## This week

- Finsihing proj0 and maybe db's hw 3 and 1 or 2 lecture.
- Finishing Algo's KD-tree, no more delay.
- Start project.
