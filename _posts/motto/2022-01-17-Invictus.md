Out of the night that covers me  
  
Black as the Pit from pole to pole  
<!--excerpt-->

I thank whatever gods may be  
  
For my unconquerable soul.  
  
In the fell clutch of circumstance  
  
I have not winced nor cried aloud.  
  
Under the bludgeonings of fate  

My head is bloody, but unbowed.  
  
Beyond this place of wrath and tears  
 
Looms but the Horror of the shade  
  
And yet the meance of the years  
  
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.  
  
It matters not how strait the gate  
  
How charged with punishment the scroll  
 
I am the master of my fate
 
I am the captain of my soul.
