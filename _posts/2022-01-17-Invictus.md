夜色沉沉将我笼罩  
Out of the night that covers me  

漆黑犹如地底暗道  
Black as the Pit from pole to pole  
<!--excerpt-->

我要感谢上帝赐予  
I thank whatever gods may be  

我的心灵永不屈服  
For my unconquerable soul.  

环境多么凶险飘摇  
In the fell clutch of circumstance  

我也不会退缩哀嚎  
I have not winced nor cried aloud.  

挑战有时胆寒心焦  
Under the bludgeonings of fate  

血流满面我不折腰  
My head is bloody, but unbowed.  

在愤怒和悲伤之外  
Beyond this place of wrath and tears  

恐怖阴霾逐渐逼来  
Looms but the Horror of the shade  

未来无情威胁迫害  
And yet the meance of the years  

但我再也无所惧骇  
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.  

无论道路多么狭隘  
It matters not how strait the gate  

面对怎样的岁月  
How charged with punishment the scroll  

我是我命运的主宰  
I am the master of my fate:  

我是我灵魂的统帅  
I am the captain of my soul.
