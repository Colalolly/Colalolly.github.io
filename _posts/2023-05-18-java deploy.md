Java Project deploy Memo

## Deploy with idea
First, clarify what kind of Project we want to deploy.

If it hasn't have web file, then it should be a only-backend project, which should be delopy as springboot project or some others.

If it is a web project, typically it will have folder like `webapp` or `WEB-INF`

For springboot project, must have a main class for springboot application configuration. Then we can run it. 

I waste a lot of time to determine that my project only have backend.
