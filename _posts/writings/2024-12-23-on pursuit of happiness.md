# On pursuit of happiness

As human , once people realize existence aware of $ of life, they immediately face a problem: how to live a life, and what's the target of personal life. It's a problem superior than all other problems as a man doesn't have many opportunities to change his answer to this problem. The answer of mine will be pursuit of happiness.

**revised**: As humans, once we become aware of the existence of life, we are immediately confronted with a fundamental question: how should we live, and what is the purpose of our personal lives? This question surpasses all others because we have few chances to revise our answer. For me, the answer lies in the pursuit of happiness.

Happiness,

Not everyone can face the existence of life, a mixture of uncertain things we cannot foresee, is composed by choice of people. Some people say life is misery and all things are fake, so they quit from real life tend to live with illusion. Some think whatever people choice, it's vain, it's meaningless, so adopt materialism.

**revised**: Not everyone can fully confront the reality of life -- a blend of uncertainties beyond our control, shaped by the choices we make. Some say life is full of suffering and illusions, leading them to withdraw from reality and embrace fantasy. Others believe that no matter what path we choose, everything is meaningless, driving them toward materialism.

Academic Writing Requirement: Polish and Depth.

Level of the Essay:
The essay appears to be at an early intermediate level. It explores philosophical ideas about life and happiness, but the structure, coherence, and development of arguments are somewhat limited. The writing shows thoughtful reflection but lacks polish and depth often expected in higher-level academic essays.

Does This Fulfill the Writer's Argument?
Partially.
The essay introduces a meaningful topic—how to live and pursue happiness—but the argument feels underdeveloped. The introduction touches on existential questions, but the body lacks clear elaboration, concrete examples, or logical progression to fully argue the writer’s point.

For example:

The idea of materialism or illusion as life choices is interesting, but these concepts are presented briefly without analysis or comparison to the pursuit of happiness.
There is no clear definition or exploration of happiness itself, leaving the reader wondering how the writer views it.

What Is Lacking (Compared to Academic Essay Standards)?

Thesis Statement (Clarity of Argument):
The essay suggests a focus on the pursuit of happiness, but there is no clearly stated thesis that outlines the central argument.

Example of a possible thesis:
"This essay argues that the pursuit of happiness, grounded in responsibility and engagement with reality, is the most fulfilling way to live."

Essay Structure (Organization):

The structure feels fragmented. Academic essays typically follow a clear structure:
Introduction → Body Paragraphs → Conclusion
Each body paragraph should focus on one main idea (e.g., defining happiness, refuting materialism, exploring responsibilities).

Supporting Evidence and Examples:

Academic writing relies on evidence—this can include quotes, references, real-life examples, or philosophical theories.
The essay introduces broad concepts like materialism and illusion but does not support these ideas with references or examples.

Counterarguments (Acknowledgment of Different Views):

A well-rounded essay addresses opposing views. For instance, discussing why some people choose materialism and how that contrasts with the pursuit of happiness adds depth.

Conclusion (Synthesis of Ideas):

The essay ends abruptly. A strong academic essay concludes by summarizing key points and reinforcing the thesis.

Example:
"In conclusion, while some may seek refuge in materialism or illusion, embracing the pursuit of happiness through engagement with life allows for a more meaningful existence."

Suggestions for Improvement:
Clarify the Thesis: Clearly state the essay's main argument early on.
Expand the Body: Develop paragraphs that explore different facets of the argument—what happiness means, why it matters, and how it compares to alternative life views.
Use Examples: Reference philosophers (e.g., Aristotle's idea of eudaimonia) or real-world examples to strengthen arguments.
Refine Language: Improve grammar and clarity to ensure smooth reading and logical flow.
